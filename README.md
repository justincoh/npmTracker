npmTracker - Tracking downloads for npm modules
---
I couldn't find a node package statistics page I liked, so I built one [here] -- with node, of course.  Thanks to the fine folks at [npm], the data is easy to get to.

The page is pretty minimal at the moment, but I'm currently rebuilding the backend to make way for a couple of extensions, so stay tuned!
