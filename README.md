npmTracker - Tracking downloads for npm modules
---
I couldn't find a node package statistics page I liked, so I built one [here] (with node, of course).  Thanks to the fine folks at [npm], the data is easy to get to.

The page is pretty minimal at the moment, but I'm working on extensions:

1. Input field to get more module data
2. Selectable date ranges.  Right now only 2015-01-01 until the current date is available

Enjoy!
